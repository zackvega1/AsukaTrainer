DISCLAIMER: I AM A ROBOTICS MAJOR NOT A CS MAJOR THIS CODE IS VERY UGLY AND NOT GOOD 

Requirements:
Python
Pygame

How to Run:

> Go to this directory in a terminal
> Use the Command 
>> python main.py [put your buttons here]


For the hitbox the button layout is 
2 3 5 4
0 1 [the last 2 buttons(the triggers) will not work with this code]

EXAMPLE:
if you are using a hitbox and have your buttons as 

Punch Slash HeavySlash
Kick

you would use the command 

python main.py 2 0 3 5


This will start the program

To cast spells do 236 + a button 

To change decks do 22 + P K or S respectively
